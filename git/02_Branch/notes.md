By default : It is master branch, you have to rename as Main(for global use)

1: git diff -> see what changes you done
2: git reset first.html -> remove from the staging area
3: git show "commit ID" -> History of that commit
4: git log --file_name  -> to check all commit of a prticular file

<!-- ************ Branching ********** -->
1: git branch -> it shows the all branch with HEAD is pointing to which branch
2: git branch "branch-name"  -> for creating the branch
3: git checkout "branch-name" -> switch to any branch


both checkout and switch are same
-> git switch "branch-name"

<!-- ************* -->
5: git switch -c "branch-name" -> At a time create branch and move to that branch
6: git checkout -b "branch-name" -> same like switch


firstly move to branch where you want to merge then type that branch name you want to merge, then delete the second branch (so history is clean)
7: git merge "branch-name"
8: git branch -d "name"

<!-- ****************** -->
when you make a copy and working on a new branch , but main branch is not changed then during the merging there is no conflict arises.

but when the work is also going on main branch then during mergin that time you will get a merge conflict. (so resolve manually)





<!-- ****************** -->
Best practice use git fetch : it let you know what changes done in remote and you want to compare them
1: git fetch
2: git pull = git fetch + git merge

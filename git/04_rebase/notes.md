merge and rebase are same but in rebase it delete the history of other branch (it clean the history)

don't run the rebase command from the main/master branch instead of that run in side branch

<!-- ************** -->
git push --set-upstream origin main : set-upstream means we are setting for the future command so again and again i don't need to run this ,
just run  -> git push origin main
<!-- ************** -->

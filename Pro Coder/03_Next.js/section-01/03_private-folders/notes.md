if you want to make a folder that not show in UI , use the private folder

-> _foldername  : now next.js not consider this folder for routing
<!-- ************************ -->
when inside "components" folder page.js is not exist then entire file of this folder not render

-> when page.js is present then only page.js file is render
<!-- ************************ -->
when you want to not render specific folder even if contain the page.js file then use the private folder(_foldername)

static routing : when we create the fixed route like "localhost:3000/home/services.....  ,these are fixed written in code

dynamic routing : when user enter anything in url and you have to capture like "localhost:3000/home/blogs/143
      localhost:3000/home/blogs/1467657
      localhost:3000/home/blogs/1467
      here blog number is dynamic routing 
<!-- **********Both rendring part of SSR ***************** -->
static rendring : in development mode our static routes(page) run but in the development mode in not run

dyamic rendring : it runs only development mode (jo next.js ka server run karta hai) jab koi dynamic route par jata hai

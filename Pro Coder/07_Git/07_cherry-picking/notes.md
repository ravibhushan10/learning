If you want to pick some (only specific work) form the another branch then you have to pick some changes... without the merging the branch into the current main branch ....


Then here we used the cherry picking
git cherry-pick "commit id"

<!-- ****************** -->
git commit -m "message" && git push -> it do the commit and push the code into the github also.

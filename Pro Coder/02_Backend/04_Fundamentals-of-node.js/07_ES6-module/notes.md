<!-- node.js have module system not the javascript so you have to tell js this is module so make the package.json file -->

->  by default js support CJS module system , so use ES6 you have to tell this is type "module"


<!-- ************* -->
you can give the name to file : .cjs/.mjs

<!-- ****************** -->

<!-- ******************* -->
Capturing vs non-capturing group

?: -> non-capturing group

(a|b) (d|E) -> Both are capturing group and we can backrefrence like(\1\2)
(?:a|b) (d|E) -> First group is non-capturing group we can't backrefrence like(\1), but in the case of second group we can backrefrence(\2)

-> we can give the name to the capturing group , but not to the non-capturing group
(?<ravi>a|b)
-> And we can backrefrence through the group name \k<ravi>
